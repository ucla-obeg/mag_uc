To do: 

- Make sure NaNs are properly dealt with. right now setnan2zero turns NaNs to 0, and allowss the code to run when
  NaN are introduced, e.g. by the forcings. This is dangerous, should be recoded

- Reorganize Input strategy to use files that already contain requrired forcings, rahter than creating them
  inside the mag_run code.

- Check time stepping consitency between MAG and the forcing files, maybe make it more general and safe
